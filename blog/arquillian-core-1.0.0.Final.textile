p. The Final release contain some component upgrades that are exposed by the Arquillian BOM

* ShrinkWrap 1.0.0
* ShrinkWrap Resolver 1.0.0-beta-6
* ShrinkWrap Descriptors 2.0.0-alpha-2

p. The @ShrinkWrap Descriptor@ 2.x release is quite different from the 1.x series, but it's the way forward

* Maven artifactiId @shrinkwrap-descriptors-impl@ has been replaced by
** @shrinkwrap-descriptors-impl-javaee@ - EE 5 & 6 Descriptors
** @shrinkwrap-descriptors-impl-jboss@ - JBossAS Specific Descriptors
** @shrinkwrap-descriptors-impl-misc@ - Jetty Descriptors

With @ShrinkWrap Descriptor@ 2.x you can expect all package names and fluent api's to have changed, but they still have the same feel to them, and it shouldn't be too difficult to do the transition:

bc(prettify). Descriptors.create(BeansDescriptor.class)
	.createDecorators().clazz(MyDecorator.class.getName()).up()
	.createAlternatives().clazz(MyAlternative.class.getName()).up()
	.exportAsString()
